<h1>BendFields - Source Code readme</h1>
<p>We provide pseudo-C++ code to generate a non-orthogonal 2D crossfield from a sparse set of constraints based on the BendFields energy. 
While not directly compilable, this source code should form a good basis for reproducing our work. To use the code you need to
provide sparse constraints on the crossfield.
</p>
<p>
We provide four main classes. The first two classes implement the data structures to store the crossfield and the transition functions. 
The class <i>HarmonicCrossField</i> initializes the crossfield (Section 6, NON-ORTHOGONAL 2D CROSS FIELDS - Greedy mixed-integer optimization). 
Its output crossfield is taken as input by the <i>BendField</i> class (Section 6, NON-ORTHOGONAL 2D CROSS FIELDS - Nonlinear optimization). 
<ul>
<li> <b>CrossField</b> stores and handles crossfield representations (angle and vector-based) <a href="crossfield.h"> .h </a> | <a href="crossfield.cpp"> .cpp </a> </li>
<li> <b>PeriodJumpField</b> handles crossfield transition functions (integer field expressing correspondence between neighbouring crosses in the CrossField, also called <i>period jump</i>) <a href="periodjumpfield.h"> .h </a> | <a href="periodjumpfield.cpp"> .cpp </a> </li>
<li> <b>HarmonicCrossField</b> takes a partially-initialized period jump field (initialized to 0 when possible) and a crossfield (with some sparse constraints defined), and returns an interpolated crossfield with a harmonic energy, and a complete PeriodJumpField <a href="harmoniccrossfield.h"> .h </a> | <a href="harmoniccrossfield.cpp"> .cpp </a> </li>
<li> <b>BendField</b> takes a initialized period jump field and a crossfield (with sparse constraints defined) and returns a crossfield interpolated with the BendField energy <a href="bendfield.h"> .h </a> | <a href="bendfield.cpp"> .cpp </a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Our code is based on the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://opencv.org/"> OpenCV  </a> (at least 2.3.1)</li>
  <li> <a href="http://qt-project.org/">  Qt  </a> (at least 4.8.0)</li>
  <li> <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page"> Eigen++ </a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We plan to release an extended version of our source code which will include the estimation of surface normals from the 2D crossfield (Section 5.3 of our paper).
Please visit the webpage of the project for updates.
